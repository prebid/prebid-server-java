Please note that some of the bidder adapters require separate authentication parameters
and contracts in order to integrate, as server-to-server integrations pose a greater risk of
accidentally or purposefully misrepresenting the inventory and audience being sold. Please consult the
bidders with whom you would like to integrate on this matter to ensure that the appropriate agreements
are in place to proceed forward.

The following adapters are fully supported in the Java implementation by the owning exchange:

- rubicon

All other adapters have been ported from Go and basic testing has been done. The project team will reach out to the following entities
for review and approval of the ported adapter:

- adform
- appnexus
- audienceNetwork
- conversant
- ix
- lifestreet
- openx
- pubmatic
- pulsepoint
- sovrn
