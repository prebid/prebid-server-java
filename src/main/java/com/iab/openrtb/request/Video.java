 * {@link Banner} object in Section 3.2.6) that define these companion ads.
 * <p>The presence of a {@link Video} as a subordinate of the {@link Imp} object

 * publisher’s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner,
 * audio, and/or native by also including as {@link Imp} subordinates objects of
 * those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of
