/**
 * The Native Object defines the native advertising opportunity available for bid via this bid request.
 * It will be included as a JSON-encoded string in the bid request’s imp.native field or as a direct JSON object,
 * depending on the choice of the exchange. While OpenRTB 2.x officially supports only JSON-encoded strings,
 * many exchanges have implemented a formal object. Check with your integration docs.
 * <p>
 * Note: Prior to VERSION 1.1, the specification could be interpreted as requiring the native request to have a
 * root node with a single field “native” that would contain the object above as its value.
 * The Native Markup Request Object specified above is now the root object.
