/**
 * This object represents a native type impression. Native ad units are intended
 * to blend seamlessly into the surrounding content (e.g., a sponsored Twitter
 * or Facebook post). As such, the response must be well-structured to afford
 * the publisher fine-grained control over rendering.
 * <p>The Native Subcommittee has developed a companion specification to OpenRTB
 * called the Dynamic Native Ads API. It defines the request parameters and
 * response markup structure of native ad units. This object provides the means
 * of transporting request parameters as an opaque string so that the specific
 * parameters can evolve separately under the auspices of the Dynamic Native Ads
 * API. Similarly, the ad markup served will be structured according to that
 * specification.
 * <p>The presence of a Native as a subordinate of the {@link Imp} object
 * indicates that this impression is offered as a native type impression. At the
 * publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner,
 * video, and/or audio by also including as {@link Imp} subordinates objects of
 * those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of
 * the offered types.
