/**
 * This object represents an audio type impression. Many of the fields are

 * optionally including an array of {@link Banner} objects (refer to the
 * {@link Banner} object in Section 3.2.6) that define these companion ads.
 * <p>The presence of a {@link Audio} as a subordinate of the {@link Imp} object
 * indicates that this impression is offered as an audio type impression. At the
 * publisher’s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner,
 * video, and/or native by also including as {@link Imp} subordinates objects of
 * those types. However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of
 * the offered types.
