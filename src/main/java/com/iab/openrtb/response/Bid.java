 * IMPORTANT: unlike other data classes this one is mutable (annotated with {@link Data} instead of
 * {@link lombok.Value}). Motivation: during the course of processing bids could be altered several times (price
 * adjustment, post-processing). Creating new instance of the bid in each of these cases seems to cause unnecessary
 * memory pressure. In order to avoid unnecessary allocations this class is made mutable (as an exception) i.e. this
