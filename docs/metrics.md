# Full list of application metrics

This document describes all metrics collected and submitted to configured backends by the Prebid Server.

## System metrics
- `vertx.http.servers.[IP]:[PORT].open-netsockets.count` - current number of open connections

where:
- `[IP]` should be equal to IP address of bound network interface on cluster node for Prebid Server (for example: `0.0.0.0`)
- `[PORT]` should be equal to `http.port` configuration property

Other available metrics can found at [Vert.x Dropwizard Metrics](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-dropwizard-metrics/java/#_the_metrics) page.
