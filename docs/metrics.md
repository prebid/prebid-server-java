# Full list of application metrics

This document describes all metrics collected and submitted to configured backends by the Prebid Server.

## System metrics
Other available metrics not mentioned here can found at 
[Vert.x Dropwizard Metrics](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-dropwizard-metrics/java/#_the_metrics) page.

### HTTP server metrics
- `vertx.http.servers.[IP]:[PORT].open-netsockets.count` - current number of open connections

where:
- `[IP]` should be equal to IP address of bound network interface on cluster node for Prebid Server (for example: `0.0.0.0`)
- `[PORT]` should be equal to `http.port` configuration property

### HTTP client metrics
- `vertx.http.clients.connections.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - how long connections live
- `vertx.http.clients.connections.{m1_rate,m5_rate,m15_rate,mean_rate}` - rate of the connection occurrences
- `vertx.http.clients.requests.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - request time
- `vertx.http.clients.requests.{m1_rate,m5_rate,m15_rate,mean_rate}` - request rate

If HTTP client per destination endpoint metrics enabled:
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].queue-delay.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - wait time of a pending request in the queue
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].queue-size.count` - actual queue size
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].open-netsockets.count` - actual number of open sockets to the endpoint
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].usage.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - time of the delay between the request starts and the response ends
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].in-use` - actual number of in-flight requests
- `vertx.http.clients.endpoint.[ENDPOINT]:[PORT].ttfb` - wait time between the request ended and its response begins

### Database pool metrics
- `vertx.pools.datasouce.[DATASOURCE].queue-delay.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - duration of the delay to obtain the resource, i.e the wait time in the queue
- `vertx.pools.datasouce.[DATASOURCE].queue-size.counter` - the actual number of waiters in the queue
- `vertx.pools.datasouce.[DATASOURCE].usage.{min,max,mean,p95,p99}` - duration of the usage of the resource
- `vertx.pools.datasouce.[DATASOURCE].in-use.counter` - actual number of resources used

where `[DATASOURCE]` is a data source name, `DEFAULT_DS` by defaul.
