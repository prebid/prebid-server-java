# Starting Cookie Syncs

This endpoint is used during cookie syncs. For technical details, see the
[Cookie Sync developer docs](../developers/cookie-syncs.md).

## POST /cookie_sync

### Sample Request
This returns a set of URLs to enable cookie syncs across bidders. (See Prebid.js documentation?) The request
must supply a JSON object to define the list of bidders that may need to be synced.

```
{
    "bidders": ["appnexus", "rubicon"],
    "coopSync": true,
    "gdpr": 1,
    "gdpr_consent": "BONV8oqONXwgmADACHENAO7pqzAAppY",
    "limit": 2
}
```

`bidders` is optional. If present, it limits the endpoint to return syncs for bidders defined in the list.

`coopSync` is optional. It overrides default value of cooperative syncing.

`gdpr` is optional. It should be 1 if GDPR is in effect, 0 if not, and omitted if the caller is unsure.

`gdpr_consent` is required if `gdpr` is `1`, and optional otherwise. If present, it should be an [unpadded base64-URL](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#page-7) encoded [Vendor Consent String](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework/blob/master/Consent%20string%20and%20vendor%20list%20formats%20v1.1%20Final.md#vendor-consent-string-format-).

`limit` is optional. If present and greater than zero, it will limit the number of syncs returned to `limit`, dropping some syncs to
get the count down to limit if more would otherwise have been returned. This is to facilitate clients not overloading a user with syncs
the first time they are encountered.

If `gdpr` is  omitted, callers are still encouraged to send `gdpr_consent` if they have it.
Depending on how the Prebid Server host company has configured their servers, they may or may not require it for cookie syncs.

If the `bidders` field is an empty list or field is omitted completely, it will attempt
to sync all bidders.

If the `coop-sync` is enabled by request value `coopSync` or default value by the Prebid Server host company, response will include
sync for bidders configured and prioritised by the host company. If no default priorities given, all active bidders will be used
for cooperative cookie sync.

### Sample Response

This will return a JSON object that will allow the client to request cookie syncs with bidders that still need to be synced:

```
{
    "status": "ok",
    "bidder_status": [
        {
            "bidder": "appnexus",
            "usersync": {
                "url": "someurl.com",
                "type": "redirect",
                "supportCORS": false
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

### Special behavior for HOST-BIDDER

if `host-cookie` exists and `uids` cookie contains HOST-BIDDER uid with different value - the `host-cookie` value will be used.

So, available scenarios:
1. `host-cookie` specified, `uids.HOST-BIDDER` exists, `host-cookie` value **is equal** to  `uids.HOST-BIDDER`: no action (HAPPY PATH)
2. `host-cookie` specified, `uids.HOST-BIDDER` exists, `host-cookie` value **is NOT equal** to  `uids.HOST-BIDDER`: use `host-cookie` value for `uids.HOST-BIDDER`
3. `host-cookie` specified, no `uids.HOST-BIDDER`: use `host-cookie` value for `uids.HOST-BIDDER`
4. no `host-cookie`, `uids.HOST-BIDDER` exists: no action (continue use  `uids.HOST-BIDDER` existing value)
5. no `host-cookie`, no `uids.HOST-BIDDER`: no action

In both of cases 2 and 3 the `uids.HOST-BIDDER` is broken, but `host-cookie` is valid value. So, `uids.HOST-BIDDER` value should be updated.
In regular situation PBS just put pre-configured `usersync-url` in `/cookie_sync` response.
But for `HOST-BIDDER` it is not necessary to call `usersync-url`for obtaining new UID because we already have it in `host-cookie`.

So, all we need is to use direct `/setuid?bidder=%s&gdpr=%s&gdpr_consent=%s&uid=%s` url as `usersync-url` in `/cookie_sync` response to set http cookie to user.
