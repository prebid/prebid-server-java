## Functional tests

Main language: Groovy. Project functional tests use [Spock](https://spockframework.org/) as a main testing framework.
Also used [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for running PBS and other services.
And [MockServer](https://www.mock-server.com/) for mocking external services.

## Getting Started

- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
- Set launchContainers system property to 'true'

### Prepare PBS image

`mvn clean -B package -DskipUnitTests=true docker:build` - to build image

> Don't forget to rebuild image for manual test start (after change in code)

### Run integration tests

- You can use `mvn verify` - to include all previous steps (including java test) because groovy runs
  in `failsafe:integration-test` phase
- Or use more granular `mvn -B verify -DskipUnitTests=true` for functional tests only

## Developing

Functional tests need to have name template **.\*Spec.groovy**

- `/functional/*Spec` - contain all test suites.
- `/functional/util` - different useful methods and wrappers.
- `/functional/repository` - interaction with DB. Notice, that some related objects need to use ID generated by DB.
  Primary Key will be inserted after saving instance into DB.
- `/functional/service/PrebidServerService` - responsible for all PBS http calls.
- `/functional/testcontainers/Dependencies` - stores dependencies and manages mySql and NetworkServiceContainer containers.
- `/functional/testcontainers/ErrorListener` - logs request and response in case of falling test.
- `/functional/testcontainers/PbsConfig` - collects PBS properties.
- `/functional/testcontainers/PbsServiceFactory` - manage PBS containers according to container limit.
- `/functional/testcontainers/PBSTestExtension` - allows to hook into a spec’s lifecycle to add ErrorListener using annotation `PBSTest`.
- `/functional/testcontainers/TestcontainersExtension` - allow to hook into a spec’s lifecycle to start and stop support service containers using global extension.
- `/functional/testcontainers/container` - responsible for creating and configuring containers.
- `/functional/testcontainers/scaffolding/NetworkScaffolding` -  makes HTTP requests to a MockServer.


**Properties:**

`launchContainers` - responsible for starting the MockServer and the MySQLContainer container. Default value is false.
`max.containers.count` - maximum number of simultaneously running PBS containers. Default value is 2.
`skipFunctionalTests` - allow to skip funtional tests. Default value is false.
`skipUnitTests` - allow to skip unit tests. Default value is false.

**Debug:**

An application running inside a Docker container is treated as a remote application, so you can attach the debugger to it.

In order to obtain the debug port you need to use `getMappedPort(8000)` based on the desired container.

### Containers

Every container expose random port which you can see `docker ps` - running containers. (add flag `-a` to see exited containers)

You can observe logs inside contUsernameainer `docker logs <container_id>`. (You don't need to write all id, just use 2-3 symbols)

#### NetworkServiceContainer

Container for mocking different calls from PBS: prebid cache, bidders, currency conversion service, PubStack analytics, http data source

`/auction` - default mocked bidder call returns response based on information from request:

```
{
   "id":"0a00b9a1-06c0-4001-9d64-b6a3f7d995e6",
   "seatbid":[
      {
         "bid":[
            {
               "id":"c550cf25-3a09-480b-852f-e75a009bbefd",
               "impid":"b9a2756a-6aef-438c-85ed-53331a7b4c53",
               "price":1.23,
               "crid":"1"
            }
         ]
      }
   ]
}
``` 

`/cache` - mocked PBC call returns:

```
{
   "responses":[
      {
         "uuid":"8565b07a-8a64-476b-ac68-cc09b4560625"
      }
   ]
}
``` 

#### MySQLContainer

Container for Mysql database.

- Use `org/prebid/server/functional/db_schema.sql` script for scheme.
- DataBase: `prebid`
- Username: `prebid`
- Password: `prebid`

#### PrebidServerContainer

Starting image `prebid/prebid-server:latest`.
Waits for container is ready by checking "/status" endpoint.

#### TestContainer library

TestContainer will start special `Ryuk container` which will manage a lifecycle of all depending containers.
