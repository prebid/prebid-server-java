# Rubicon Bidder

Please contact your Rubicon Project account manager to get set up with a login and cookie-sync URL to run your own Prebid Server. You will be given instructions, including the available endpoints.

[Rubicon Project Prebid.js test parameters](https://github.com/prebid/Prebid.js/blob/master/modules/rubiconBidAdapter.md) will work for server as well.
